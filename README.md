A simple and lightweight battle tracker for tabletop RPGs (such as D&D, Pathfinder, Dragonbane, etc.) directly inside Obsidian.

---

## Why this plugin?
This plugin was born out of a personal need: **I wanted a simple, lightweight way to track initiative and health in my RPG sessions without overcomplicating things.** I didn't want heavy systems or cluttered panels. I just wanted something that reads my notes, lets me manage combat turns, and logs the actions. That's how **Combat Ledger** was born.

---

## Key Features

1. **YAML Frontmatter Integration**: Reads initiative, HP, maximum HP, defense (AC), and character type directly from the frontmatter of your Obsidian notes.
2. **Turn & Round Management**: Automatically sorts combatants by initiative. Highlighting the active combatant and advancing rounds.
3. **Interactive Combat Log**: Records every combat event (turn changes, damage, healing, conditions, custom notes) in a Markdown note of your choice:
   * **New Note**: Automatically generated with timestamps.
   * **Existing Note**: Appended under a specific header (e.g. `## Combat Log` / `## Registro de Combate`).
4. **Dual Language Support (EN/ES)**: Easy toggle in settings that translates the entire interface and automatically translates default conditions and log settings.
5. **Customizable Extra Fields**: Track additional numeric parameters such as MP, stamina, focus, or stress with quick click buttons.
6. **Condition Tracking**: Easily toggle states (like Stunned, Poisoned, Cursed) and see them listed on combatant cards.

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`) into your Obsidian vault's plugin directory: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/combat-ledger/`.
2. Open Obsidian settings, navigate to **Community Plugins**, and enable **Combat Ledger**.

## How it Works

### 1. Preparing Combatant Notes
Create a markdown note for each character or monster. The plugin reads metadata properties from the frontmatter YAML. By default, it expects:

```yaml
---
type: PC            # PC, Enemy, or NPC
initiative: 12
hp: 35
hp_max: 35
ac: 15
mp: 20              # Extra field
stamina: 3          # Extra field
---
```

### 2. Loading Combatants
* Open the Combat Ledger sidebar view by clicking the **Sword Ribbon Icon** on the left ribbon, or run the command `Open Combat Ledger`.
* Click **＋ Load** in the top bar.
  * If a **Combatant Folder** is defined in your settings, it will automatically load all files inside that folder.
  * If the path is empty, a modal will open allowing you to search and select one or multiple notes manually.

### 3. Setting Up the Combat Log
When combat begins or you perform the first action, if logging is enabled, a modal will prompt you to set up where you want to keep the log:
* **Create New Note**: Creates a markdown file named with the current timestamp.
* **Use Existing Note**: Lets you search and select an existing file. All actions will be written chronologically under your configured header.
* **Do Not Log**: Runs the combat in memory only.

### 4. Running the Battle
* **Advancing Turns**: Click **▶ Next Turn** to move to the next alive combatant. The round indicator increments automatically.
* **Damage/Healing**: Click **⚔ Damage / Heal** on any card to subtract or add HP.
* **Conditions**: Click **◈ Status** to toggle active conditions. You can remove a condition quickly by clicking on its badge (`Aturdido ×`) on the card.
* **Quick Notes**: Write brief notes (like *"flying 10ft high"*) using the **✎ Note** button.
* **Defeat & Revive**: Defeated characters are greyed out and skipped in the initiative order automatically.

## Configuration

In the plugin's setting tab, you can customize:
* **Language**: English or Español.
* **YAML Fields Mappings**: Adjust the exact YAML keys the plugin reads from your notes (e.g. changing `ac` to `defense`).
* **Condition List**: A comma-separated list of conditions available in the selection modal.
* **Combatant Folder**: Automate loading by targeting a specific vault folder.
* **Combat Log Settings**: Enable/disable logging, choose the target markdown header, and define the folder and naming pattern for newly created log files.
